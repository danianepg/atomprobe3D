The application was built using only JavaScript and WebGL languages, so it could be run from popular browsers in any device such as computers, tablets, smartphones, with no need to install additional software.

Some public libraries such as jQuery, three.js and jDataView were used and the credits were maintained. ;-)

To try it:
* Run index.html.
* Load a binary or text file.
* Have fun rotating and zoom-ing the visualization.
